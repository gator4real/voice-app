### Version 0.0.0.0.0.1

### Notes:

It's kinda buggy and cuts off your voice sometimes. The audio streams don't always sound good or human-like. There's also 2-3 seconds of latency from when you're done speaking until the audio returns which is poopy. Will probably do more with this..

### Instructions:

1. Open command line and run: `npm i; npm run start` on Windows or `npm i && npm run start` on mac.
2. Obtain an API Key from [Eleven Labs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/). Sign up and find your API key under Profile.
3. Input API key, press start, and select voice. Start speaking to hear the converted audio.

##### To output audio to another source on Windows:

1. Download VAC virtual audio cable. (Could also maybe use something like VoiceMeeter or any tool for the same purpose.)
2. Change ouput from browser to virtual audio cable input. (Start > Settings > System > Sound (under Advanced Sound Options) App volume and device preferences > Select top of two options and change to virtual input.)
3. Change whatever application you want to use voice in to use virtual audio cable output as input.
